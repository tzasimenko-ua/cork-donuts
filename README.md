## UX

This site is aimed at quickly capturing attention and prompting instant ordering. Simplicity and ease of navigation increases the chances of completing an order. The emphasis is on an appetizing look and emphasizing important client needs.

## User stories

Reflecting on the appearance of the site of its sections and the specified information, I proceeded from the following considerations:

- As a potential customer, the goal of this website is to provide a quick and intuitive way to understand how it facilitates the instant ordering of delicious donuts.
- As a user, I expect simplicity and ease of navigation on the website, whether I'm using a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen.
- As a visitor, it's important for me to explore the variety of offered donuts, discovering unique flavors, colors, and textures.
- As a customer, I want an easy understanding of the order placement process, payment options, and receiving my favorite donuts.
- As a user, I seek access to information about special offers, promotions, and a loyalty program.
- As a customer, I appreciate the ability to quickly contact site representatives if I have questions or specific order requirements.

### Strategy

“See and Crave” is a feature of this site that turns desire into action in a few clicks. Users are introduced to the visually appealing styling and are instantly inspired to enjoy the delightful experience of ordering tempting donuts.

### Scope

For users, the website aims to provide a basic overview of the offerings. Focusing on variety, freshness and uniqueness. Users can easily navigate the menu to explore the tempting options created.

### Structure

I stuck with the traditional online ordering process because it is not too complicated and it will be easy for users to find the information they need. The website has one long scrolling page and three non-scrolling pages. My structure has a fixed top navigation that connects the user to each section from anywhere on the page. I also included a link to the home page in the logo

**Website Sections:**

1. **Homepage:**

   - Banner with a happy child: A positive welcome with an image of a joyful child enjoying delicious donuts.
   - Production Description: Detailed information about our high production standards, emphasizing the important qualities and uniqueness of our products.
   - Call to Action (CTA): "Order Now" button encouraging users to place an order and savor the exquisite taste.

2. **Products Page:**

   - Variety of Products: Showcase a diverse assortment of donuts with exquisite flavors, accompanied by photographs of each item.

3. **Feedback Page:**

   - Feedback Form: A convenient form for customers to leave their questions, suggestions, or feedback.
   - Map and Contacts: An interactive map displaying the store location and essential contact information.

4. **Call Back Order Page:**

   - Call Back Order Form: A simple form for those who prefer to quickly place an order over the phone.

5. **Footer (on all pages):**

   - Contact Information: Links to our social media profiles, store address, and phone numbers.

### Skeleton

The website is designed to be clear and simple. With convenient navigation between pages

**Wireframe**
The wireframe is designed using Balsamiq software.

### Surface

I chose a bright and colorful donut animation for the website background for several reasons. Firstly, it creates a fun and appealing atmosphere, perfectly aligning with the theme of a donut ordering site. Secondly, such animation adds creativity and originality to the visual design, making the project stand out among competitors. Finally, this animation symbolizes joy and enjoyment, encouraging visitors to place orders and creating a positive user experience. This choice is not only stylish but also strategically justified to capture attention and provide a pleasant visual perception of the donut ordering website.
